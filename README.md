# SwapTris
### An easily moddable Tetris variant in vanilla JavaScript

SwapTris is a simple, web-based Tetris-like game whose code is very easily hackable. Its clear function-based structure can be changed without hindering other parts of the game.

<br/>

SwapTris features:

- Clear, structured code
- Hard and soft drop
- Next tetrimono preview
- Seeing where your tetrimono will land

What is different to normal Tetris?

- You have 2 active blocks that you can swap with `shift`: whilst your tetrimono is falling, you can swap it with the one you are currently holding, then again and as much as you wish.

Why is it good for me?

- You can just play it as normal Tetris
- Nice UI
- Good for learning JavaScript: modding SwapTris is simple ande amusing
